## Content

This Repository contains image-2-image translation algorithms. In folder "img2img2D," you will find the 2D implementation of CUT, Pix2Pix, and Denoising Diffusion (DDPM and DDIM in image and noise mode). In the folder diffusion3D, you will find the 3D variant of our Denoising Diffusion. We provide an introduction to how to run the 3D code and inference. We also pushed a pre-trained 3D Denoising Diffusion network (image mode) for sagittal T2w to CT (spine) translation and example data.
